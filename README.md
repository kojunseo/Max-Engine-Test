## Testing Max Engine
* This sample project is a simple example of how to use the Max Engine to run a simple model.
* Also, time is measured to see how long it takes to run the model.

## Time Comparison
* (Mini Size) MNist model is simple CNN model and time is measured while infer all test data.
* (Medium Size) Res25 model is for loop ResNet101 model 25 times with fully-connected layer, and time is measured while infer single batch test data. 
* Both model is tested on CPU.
